### Commit: `init`

**Summary**
- Created the first structured project snapshot commit after reviewing core planning and handoff docs.

  - `HANDOFF.md`
  - `IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md`
  - `README.md`
  - `SPEC_INTELLIGENCE_ROUTER.md`
  - `FILE_MANIFEST.txt`
- Established a baseline repository state for safe rollback before implementation begins.

  - frequent push cadence to maintain rollback safety
